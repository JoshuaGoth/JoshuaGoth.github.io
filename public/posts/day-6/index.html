<p><strong>Fathers Day</strong>: Unfortunately, my Spinal Stenosis was acting up today, and its flair up caused my entire left arm to go numb, so I wasn’t able to do anything other than lay in bed and try to recover. However, towards the evening, I was able to join the family. My wife made an incredible meal, my daughter was listening to one of her favorite bands, Stray Kids, while dancing in the living room, and I continued with my studies.</p>
<p>I have started learning about the CSS property <em>Flexbox</em>, and have found myself struggling greatly with this concept. Knowing that this is such an important property, and how much I will be using this as I continue with my studies as future projects, I am forced to slow down in order to allow what I am learning to sink in.</p>
<p>Although I spent much of Father’s Day in pain, I was pampered by my family and I had a great Father’s Day overall.</p>
