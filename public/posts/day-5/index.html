    Day 5 | The Web-Dev Journey

W3Schools.com has been helpful as well.

I may check this out eventually though. CSSReference.io Good reference for individual and in-depth examples of CSS usage. Web.Dev By far the best reference that I have found so far, next to MDN. Real examples and easy to follow along tutorials. Much of my time catching up on CSS will be done here, I am sure. Until Tomorrow! ~Cheers" />
