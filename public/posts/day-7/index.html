    <p><strong>More CSS practicing</strong>. Building quick little HTML pages so that I can modify the CSS with, at least, the basics (for now). I have dug deeper into flex containers, and getting my head wrapped around them.</p>
<p>Most of this morning has been with updating my primary <a href="https://JoshuaGoth.com">Blog</a>, as I am still working on my time management skills.</p>
<p>I did find a cute, helpful game for flex-containers though <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com" title="Takes me back to the 5th grade.">FlexBoxFroggy</a>. Unfortunately, no matter how many ergonomic devices I have, my condition still causes my left arm to go numb, so I need to step away from the computer from time to time, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I cant optimize my time and learn on another medium, as there are a slew of Web Development learning applications for the iPad.</p>
<p>Not launching too deep into the rabbit-hole, I took some time and learned more about markdown syntax, so that was fun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my daughter has her final exam before summer break today, my wife is managing her father&rsquo;s care, and we cannot wait for her to get home!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>On a side note</em>, I would like to figure out how to work back-links in Hugo so &gt;that I can get the graph feature on this blog working. If anyone has any tips &gt;or references that can help, please feel free to drop <a href="me@joshuagoth.com" title="Email Me">me</a> a line.</p></blockquote>
<p>~Cheers</p>
