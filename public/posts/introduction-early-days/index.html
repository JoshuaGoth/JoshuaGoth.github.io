<p>I thought it would be fun to track my daily progress as I work towards my goal of bringing some web ideas to life. The primary purpose is to have an area to safely collect my notes and progress. As I mentioned in my README.md, I am not looking for this blog to be grammatically correct, visually pleasing or pushing anyone to buy things from me.</p>
<p>I am doing this to create a log of my progress&ndash;in the old school definition of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">Blog</a>. For most people, the best way to learn is to <em>actually</em> <strong>do</strong>. So that is what I am doing. I do hope that any notes that I have made along the way, or the path that I have chosen and / or learning guides that I have followed, may help you with your journey as well.</p>
<p>I do this as another project alongside of my <a href="https://JoshuaGoth.com">primary blog</a> that I am working on (and, once again, to help me learn). I am always open to guidance, advice, and constructive criticisms, so if there is anything that you wish to share that may help, I will give it a shot (and give you credit, of course).</p>
<p><strong>I am learning so that I can create, nothing more</strong>. I am not driven by financial gains, notoriety, or success. I am driven by my passion to learn, to create. Now that I have retired from a career as a network engineer, I now have the time to pursue my dreams as a writer, inventor, artist (creator).</p>
<p><strong>Time Management</strong> is something that I am learning, and balancing two blogs, an in-progress novel series, being an active father and husband, will allow me to practice time management, and to hone my skills in work-life / home-life balance. Also, by staying focused and driven, I hope to inspire my artistic wife and daughter to continue following the path to their individual goals.</p>

<p>The web is chalked full of resources for learning. In order to keep myself from getting overwhelmed, I chose <a href="https://theodinproject.com"><em>The Odin Project</em></a> as a starting place, and will branch out from there in accordance to where my current skill-set lies as well as what I feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>My bookmarks have gone nuts since I have started down this path, so I will try to keep the links I post in accordance to what I am working with on any given day.</p>
<p>~Cheers,
