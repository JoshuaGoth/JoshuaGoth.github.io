# The Beginning of My Web Development Journey

### Why I am creating this blog
I thought it would be fun to track my daily progress as I work towards my goal of bringing some web ideas to life. The primary purpose is to have an area to safely collect my notes and progress. As I mentioned in my README.md, I am not looking for this blog to be grammatically correct, visually pleasing or pushing anyone to buy things from me. 

I am doing this to create a log of my progress--in the old school definition of a [Blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog). For most people, the best way to learn is to *actually* **do**. So that is what I am doing. I do hope that any notes that I have made along the way, or the path that I have chosen and / or learning guides that I have followed, may help you with your journey as well. 

I do this as another project alongside of my [primary blog](https://JoshuaGoth.com) that I am working on (and, once again, to help me learn). I am always open to guidance, advice, and constructive criticisms, so if there is anything that you wish to share that may help, I will give it a shot (and give you credit, of course).

**I am learning so that I can create, nothing more**. I am not driven by financial gains, notoriety, or success. I am driven by my passion to learn, to create. Now that I have retired from a career as a network engineer, I now have the time to pursue my dreams as a writer, inventor, artist (creator). 

**Time Management** is something that I am learning, and balancing two blogs, an in-progress novel series, being an active father and husband, will allow me to practice time management, and to hone my skills in work-life / home-life balance. Also, by staying focused and driven, I hope to inspire my artistic wife and daughter to continue following the path to their individual goals. 

## Where to start - The First Days
The web is chalked full of resources for learning. In order to keep myself from getting overwhelmed, I chose [*The Odin Project*](https://theodinproject.com) as a starting place, and will branch out from there in accordance to where my current skill-set lies as well as what I feel comfortable with. 

My bookmarks have gone nuts since I have started down this path, so I will try to keep the links I post in accordance to what I am working with on any given day.
