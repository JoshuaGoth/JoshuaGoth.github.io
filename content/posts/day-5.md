#Day 5
I have found that I am struggling with CSS, so venturing out to other suggested links by *The Odin Project* in 
order to aid me on my quest. I am going to put advancing through the assignments on hold until I can confidently 
grasp and feel comfortable using CSS. [MDN Web 
Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Basic_selectors) has a 
plethora of great information for beginners. 
[W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.php) has been helpful as well. 
[Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) I have not dug too far into this site, and while it looks very 
well structured and informative, I am afraid that most of the useful contents are hid behind a paywall. I may 
check this out eventually though. [CSSReference.io](https://cssreference.io/) Good reference for individual and 
in-depth examples of CSS usage. [Web.Dev](https://web.dev/learn/css/) By far the best reference that I have found 
so far, next to MDN. Real examples and easy to follow along tutorials. Much of my time catching up on CSS will be 
done here, I am sure. Until Tomorrow!
~Cheers
