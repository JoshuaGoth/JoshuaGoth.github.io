# Day 8

I am feeling pretty comfortable with what I have learned in CSS so far, at least comfortable enough to continue on with [*The Odin Project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)training courses. At last, the moment I've all been waiting for--JavaScript; The ability to start creating interactive pages, and the reason I became interested in web development. 

Closing out the evening at midnight, feeling accomplished with what I have learned. Also spent a great deal of time practicing Markdown, which I fell in love with since the first time I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

As much as I want to dive into JavaScript, it's late, and have a difficult enough time managing sleep as it is,[^2] so I will wait to dip my toes into that pond tomorrow. 

~Cheers



[^2]: My average sleep cycle lasts for no more than 2-3 hours at a time due to chronic pain from my Spinal Stenosis.
