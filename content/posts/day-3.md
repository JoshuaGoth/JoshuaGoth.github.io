# Day 3
**Learning Git / GitHub / GitHub Pages** 
Throughout my career, I have worked with developers and have seen people use GitHub--and have downloaded countless and amazing software, myself--but never understood it. 

I have been familiarizing myself with the process, and am overly impressed with how well the process is documented, not to mention how helpful the development community is. I have a long way to go, but have become somewhat familiar with the process of creating, uploading and commenting about changes. I look forward to understanding more as I grow, but for now, I have the basics down, at least for what my short-term goals are in creating a simple blog to track my progress. 

Although I have a main blog that I created a few months back on WordPress, I am very new to the front end web-development scene (obviously, that's why I am creating a blog to help me learn). I tried Jekyll, but it was a little too complicated, as I had to build and tear down the site multiple times. Granted, it may have been my lack of experience with Git and GitHub, but have had better luck, and settled with Hugo for my GitHub pages blog. 

I am using [This Template by Mich Enriksen](https://michenriksen.com/til-example-site/) and am very impressed with it. There is a lot that needed to be configured out of the box, but it was a great learning experience doing so. 

**The Odin Project**: Foundations.

As the night comes to a close, I have landed on CSS, and I know I will be spending a great deal of time in order to find myself comfortable enough to move onto JavaScript. So far, The Odin Project has been a great tool, and the links that are provided are on par with the learning material--which I am very impressed with. 

~Cheers
