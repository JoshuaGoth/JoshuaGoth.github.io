**More CSS practicing**. Building quick little HTML pages so that I can modify the CSS with, at least, the basics (for now). I have dug deeper into flex containers, and getting my head wrapped around them. 

Most of this morning has been with updating my primary [Blog](https://JoshuaGoth.com), as I am still working on my time management skills. 

I did find a cute, helpful game for flex-containers though [FlexBoxFroggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com "Takes me back to the 5th grade."). Unfortunately, no matter how many ergonomic devices I have, my condition still causes my left arm to go numb, so I need to step away from the computer from time to time, but that doesn't mean I cant optimize my time and learn on another medium, as there are a slew of Web Development learning applications for the iPad. 

Not launching too deep into the rabbit-hole, I took some time and learned more about markdown syntax, so that was fun. 

Meanwhile, my daughter has her final exam before summer break today, my wife is managing her father's care, and we cannot wait for her to get home!

>*On a side note*, I would like to figure out how to work back-links in Hugo so >that I can get the graph feature on this blog working. If anyone has any tips >or references that can help, please feel free to drop [me](me@joshuagoth.com "Email Me") a line.
