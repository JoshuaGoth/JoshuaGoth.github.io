# Day 4

**I Continued** on the Odin Journey, continuing to work through the css projects. 

A little side-tracked as I have been tinkering with the Hugo Theme to see what else I can add. I would like to figure out how to add an author page, or be able to embed my [Gravatar profile](https://gravatar.com/softlyatomic1eb1703e85) in markdown, but not sure if that is possible. But, hey, what good is doing anything if you don't take a break to have fun, right? 

The night is coming to a close, and my wife and I are going out to the theater to see the movie [Sinners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinners_(2025_film)). A much deserved, and long overdue date. 

Our family has been working hard on our individual projects, so today was not only productive for myself. My wife has found inspiration for creating an online clothing store, and my daughter is now able to read Korean, as she has been preparing for her trip next year. 

Its late. Calling it. Until tomorrow!

~Cheers
