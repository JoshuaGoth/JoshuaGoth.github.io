# Week 2
**Due to the amount of projects** that I am working on and combined with my daily life, as a father and husband, I feel I only have time for weekly updates in order to keep myself accountable with my journey to Web-Dev skills. 

Personally, I prefer long term rewards to short term ones, so I focus my studies on areas that I am struggling in, and I have found that wrapping my head around some JavaScript concepts was more difficult than anticipated. Instead of progressing and skipping over content I couldn’t grasp—which just cascades into complete understanding as chapters go on— I have worked on practicing concepts over and over again until that magical, mental *click* happens before I continue further. 

I have shifted my focus to JavaScript. I feel I have a comfortable foundation for both HTML and CSS, so I purchased the book [**JavaScript Quick Start Guide**](https://quickstartguides.com), by CliveBankMedia, and will work through that before continuing onto *The Odiin Project* and paths of learning that branch off of Odin’s coursework. 

I have started chapter 5, and am impressed with both the methods, exercise and approach to help those new to code learn as effecicantly as possible. The Courses have detailed, and real life projects to work through as well as detailed chapter outlines on [GitHub](https://github.com/clydebankmedia/JavaScript-QuickStartGuide).
