# My Journey into web development
**I am a** retired network engineer looking foward to getting into something new. I will be recording my journey at http://github.JoshuaGoth.com, which is a side blog
to one of my project blogs, https://JoshuaGoth.com. 

### I am excited to Join the Community

I look forward to learning, creating, and participating with others as I work towards my goal of bringing my ideas to life. I am starting my path with **The Odin Project**
and it has been informative. Since I retired, I am finding pleasure in the IT field, once again.
