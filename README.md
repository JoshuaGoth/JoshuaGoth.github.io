# My Journey into web development
**I am a** retired network engineer looking foward to getting into something new. I will be recording my journey at http://github.JoshuaGoth.com, which is a side blog
to one of my project blogs, https://JoshuaGoth.com. 

### I am excited to Join the Community

I look forward to learning, creating, and participating with others as I work towards my goal of bringing my ideas to life. I am starting my path with **The Odin Project**
and it has been informative. Since I retired, I am finding pleasure in the IT field, once again. 

### My goal for the design of this blog will be to separate this journey into two parts. 
The blog will contain aspects of my day, both studies and personal—what I have learned, done, etc—and the notes section will contain answers to the snags that hung me up, including processes that I will find myself using a lot. I am not looking to reinvent the wheel in any way, shape, or form—as solutions to every struggle have been well documented, and can be found online—, and notes that I jot down will be for my own personal reference. However, I hope that the snags that I have encountered, as well as the solutions that I have jotted down, can help others in their own journey.

**Formatting and grammatical errors.** I am not going to spend a lot of time with trying to make this blog look perfect. That isn’t the point of why I spun this up. This blog is just to document my journey, nothing more. Typos, mistakes, and grammatical errors will be inevitable, and that is okay. I will not be running this through AI engines in order to correct the grammar or formatting. This is nothing more than a text log written from the command line—a simple log with a simple purpose: To record the path and what it took in order to reach my goal.

With that said, allow me to begin, and I hope that you find this adventure informative and, possibly, entertaining! ~Cheers!
